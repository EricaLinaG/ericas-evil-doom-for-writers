** Introduction and Notable Features
** Prerequisites and Installation
First, make sure that you have at least Emacs 27.1 installed, and have made sure that Git and the other prerequisites of Doom-Emacs are satisfied:
[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs#prerequisites][Doom-Emacs - Prerequisites]]
*** Doom-Emacs
Before you install anything, you need to make sure that there isn’t a ~.emacs.d~ directory on your machine. If you are running Emacs, there is, so you need to either delete or rename it.

To install Doom-Emacs, clone it into ~.emacs.d~ , and run the Doom-Emacs installation script:

=git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d=

=~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install=

Try running Emacs now to make sure that Doom-Emacs is up and running.

If you run into issues, where Doom-Emacs has a hiccup, a simple restart usually fixes it.

Once Doom-Emacs is up and running, it’s time to prepare the installation of Hotel California.

*** Additional Requirements
**** Org-Roam
We are using Org-Roam 2, and often requires a C compiler installed on the system for the ~emacs-sqlite~ requirement. If you don’t have a C compiler installed, and you get an error from Doom-Emacs Doctor, see this section of the Org-Roam manual:

[[https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#C-Compiler][Org-Roam manual - Installation - Compiler]]

*** Installation
Delete the ~.doom.d~ directory that the Doom-Emacs installation script created.

Clone the Hotel California repository into =~/.doom.d=, like this:

=git clone https://github.com/jacmoe/.doom.d ~/.doom.d=

Now run the Doom-Emacs ~sync~ command:

=~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync=

Before running Emacs again, check with the Doom-Emacs doctor that everything is alright:

=~./.emacs.d/bin doom doctor=

If it doesn’t find any errors, you should be able to successfully run this Emacs configuration.
