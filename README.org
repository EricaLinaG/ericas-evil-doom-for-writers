[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs#prerequisites]]
*** Doom-Emacs
Before you install anything, you need to make sure that there isn’t a ~.emacs.d~ directory on your machine. If you are running Emacs, there is, so you need to either delete or rename it.

To install Doom-Emacs, clone it into ~.emacs.d~ , and run the Doom-Emacs installation script:
=git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d=
=~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install=

Try running Emacs now to make sure that Doom-Emacs is up and running.

If you run into issues, where Doom-Emacs has a hickup, a simple restart usually fixes it.
