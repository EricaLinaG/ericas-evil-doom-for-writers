* doom.d

My =Doom-Emacs= configuration.

[[file:splash/emacs.png]]

** Introduction and Notable Features
** Prerequisites and Installation
First, make sure that you have at least Emacs 27.1 installed, and have made sure that Git and the other prerequisites of Doom-Emacs are satisfied:
[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs#prerequisites][Doom-Emacs - Prerequisites]]
*** Doom-Emacs
Before you install anything, you need to make sure that there isn’t a ~.emacs.d~ directory on your machine. If you are running Emacs, there is, so you need to either delete or rename it.

To install Doom-Emacs, clone it into ~.emacs.d~ , and run the Doom-Emacs installation script:

=git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d=

=~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install=

Try running Emacs now to make sure that Doom-Emacs is up and running.

If you run into issues, where Doom-Emacs has a hiccup, a simple restart usually fixes it.

Once Doom-Emacs is up and running, it’s time to prepare the installation of Hotel California.

*** Additional Requirements

**** Org-Roam

=org-roam= uses a custom SQLite binary to store its database, and it will compile it when it installs. So there must be a C compiler available to Emacs.

On Linux, there are very likely to be a C compiler installed, but Windows is different.

One option is to use MSYS2, which is Linux distribution for Windows. Follow the instructions on [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2 home page]]. Be sure to install the full mingw-w64 GCC software collection.

Make sure that you add the =bin= directory of you MSYS2 installation to your system path, so that Emacs can find it.

On my machine, I had to add =C:\msys64\mingw64\bin=

**** Aspell
***** Linux

If Aspell is not installed, install =aspell= using your package manager.

***** Windows

Assuming that you installed MSYS2, including the mingw compiler suite, you can simply open up a MSYS2 command line and run:

=pacman -Ss aspell=

That will give you a list of aspell related packages to install.

Here's the packages that I installed:

=pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-aspell=

=pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-aspell-en=

If you followed the guide for how to install the C compiler, then Emacs will be able to find =aspell=, and all should be well.

**** Proselint
Proselint is required by the on-the-fly language checker.

Simply follow the [[https://github.com/amperser/proselint#installation][Proselint installation instructions]] and make sure to, if on Windows, to add the location of the Proselint binary to your PATH. The message you get from Python's pip installation procedure reminds you of what exact path you need to add.


*** Installation
Delete the ~.doom.d~ directory that the Doom-Emacs installation script created.

Clone the Hotel California repository into =~/.doom.d=, like this:

=git clone https://github.com/jacmoe/.doom.d ~/.doom.d=

Now run the Doom-Emacs ~sync~ command:

=~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync=

Before running Emacs again, check with the Doom-Emacs doctor that everything is alright:

=~./.emacs.d/bin doom doctor=

If it doesn’t find any errors, you should be able to successfully run this Emacs configuration.
